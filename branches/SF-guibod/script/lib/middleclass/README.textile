h1. MiddleClass

Lua OOP classes usually end being:
* multi-file libraries, too difficult to understand
* very small libraries, not very powerful

Middleclass attemps to be a mid-sized library (100 lines of code, on a single file), with clean, easy to understand code, and yet powerful enough to be used in most cases.
