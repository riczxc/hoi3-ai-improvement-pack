- List all object that support direct comparison and provide
middleclass "__eq" method.
see "eq" at http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.5.9

- Allow type hinting. Instead of putting a simple string put an object that
precise a string for type but also some hints such as string/array size, min/max,
...

- Add some configuration support to define a list of plausible result for
Impl or randomly generated content in order to get a working set of province,
country, building...
Most likely some convenience function/method to be deployed inside MethodImpl()
