- List all object that support direct comparison and provide
middleclass "__eq" method.
see "eq" at http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.5.9

- Add some configuration support to define a list of plausible result for
Impl or randomly generated content in order to get a working set of province,
country, building...
Most likely some convenience function/method to be deployed inside MethodImpl()

- Replace tons of self:loadResultOrImplOrRandom by a new callable FunctionObject
Maybe extend Hoi3Oject to use a static function definition list
Change Hoi3Object object in order to use function NAME and class NAME (instead of referenc)
