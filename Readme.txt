#Updated
- Major revision on Trade system
- The decisions and events are now vanilla selectable by humans but for the AI it goes more historical (for ppl who do not understand it. This is better then vanilla no mather what. Vanilla did always on the same date and alwasy on the wrong one so your not getitng more free play if you remove this. This is more a bug fix)

- Handling trades has been made faster to once every 5 days.
- When more historcal faction joining is disabled it will use vanilla instead of some minor preventions.
- Can no longer set offer trading and evaluate trade seperately but they count as the same.
