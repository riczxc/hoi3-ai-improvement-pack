- List all object that support direct comparison and provide
middleclass "__eq" method.
see "eq" at http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.5.9

- Do something about # operator support... we can't rely on count through for loop :(

- In order to save space in serialized space, maybe support a store scalar values
for CString, CFixedPoint, CArrayFix, ... and other primitive types.
For this, we may need to define functions that are NEVER saved but relies a valid properties.

- create a summary report for all functions calls, with detailled output for gang-banged functions

- restore save support for static methods
